# it's aoubt how address memory locations 

we can addresss memory using **absolute 64 bit addresses** or we can use **RIP relative addresses**, which are relative to the RIP ( instruction pointer )

## Position Independent Code 
position independent code can be loaded in any addresss in memory

## Absolute addressing 
- it is slow 
- can address more than 2 GB 
- required for programs larger than 2GB

## Relative addressing
