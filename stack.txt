base pointer -> starting address of the stack
stack pointer -> ending address of the stack

base pointer and stack pointer both creates a stack frame for a function ( starting address in the stack - ending address in the stack makes  a stack frame )

when we enter a function on we have to create a stack frame for that function 
when we leave a function we have to restores the stack frame of the caller function 

restoring the frame
-------------------
we clear allocated stack for the current function by adding a number ( add esp , 4) , or by assiging the esp ( mov esp , ebp ) 
once we cleared the stack , we will have stack pointer restored 
then we have to restore the base pointer , to restore the base pointer we have to pop the stack pushed for the
